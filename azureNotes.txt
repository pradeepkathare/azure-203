azure notes
1 : go for all services in portal
Resouces : Any service running in azure is called resouce
resource group:grouping the resources is called resourcegroup

===class 1 : Provisioning VMs=======
1 : custom-images can be built 2 ways:
	a)use market-image and make it modifcation and you as source image for other images
	b)VHD:using virtual harddisk
2 : removing machine related configurations from windows or linux os is called de-provisioning or generalising application.
3 : custom-images can be copied between regions
	a)azure cli -image copy extension
	b)Powershell -Manual process
4 : term image is used to vm provisoning
5 : snapshot is used for disk copy

======Class 2 :Deploying Multiple vms================
References : 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview
1 : policy cares about resource properties for example 
	a) vms that allowed in particular regions
	b) vms sku(stop keeping unit):business allowing only particualr skus and putting restrictions on the other for cost constraints
	c) Policies are controlled/applied on the subscriptions so when we create the policy to allowed location then it will not allow to create 
		any resources outside that location and fail in review/validation part

2 : AzureDeployment command has mode incremental or complete
	a) if incremental then it will not delete existing group
	b) if complete then restricting to delete all and create then given command

===class 3: Securing VMs and data ==============================================


1:what is SSL and TLS
2 :MSI -> MANAGED SERVICE IDENTITY,TDE->TRANSPERENT DATA ENCRYPTION
3 : Azure recommends to use MSI instead of keyvalut because ,there is no need to store client and secret-id of azure-active directory and validate/authenticate through it before fetching 
	keyvalut data
4 : To access Keyvault u neeed to perform authentication ,this can be done using azure active directory
5 : Need to learn keyvalut
6 : SSE :secure encryption is enabled by default to azure storage but not to vm disk
7 : when data is stored in storage like blob,queue,page,table and etc it is encrypted by using microsoft managed key.
8 : we can encrypt the storage data by using cutom keys,but this need to be stored in key-vault and configure azure storage to use this keys while encrypting.
9 : data at rest and data at transit(data which will be flowed between services or through internet)

============Concepts to learn =================================

1 : Virtual network ,subnet
2 : NIC(To create nic we have to create vnet,subnet,nsg,publicIpAddress)
3 : PublicIPAddress->static and dynamic
4 : PrivateIPAddress
5 : NetworkSecurityGroup
6 : Firewall in system(opening port)
7 : Proivsioning vms
8 : fdisk in linux or interface parted command
9:/etc/fstab (mount disk permantely)
10:vm disk toplogy

===class 1 : Provisioning VMs================================================

1 : Create vm but it shouldnot be accessible from outside and vicerversa
2 : where will ssh keys stored locally in systems or how it get authenticated
3 : Difference between cloudshell,powershell,cli(when to use what)
4 : Y SSH in linux and RDP in windows
5 : How to specify inbound,tcp,priority and etc in NSR(Network security rule) using CLI(This can be achived using powershell in granular way )
6 : what is Generalising vm for windows and de-provisioning linux vm
7 : can we run cli commands cloudshell
8 : how to make autoshutdown the vms using cli and powershell 
9 : how to restrict number of vms per user or per lab using cli and poweshell
10 : how to add artifacts while creating vm using cli and powershell,
===class 1 : Provisioning VMs END================================================

===class 2 : Deploying VMs using ARN template =================================
1 : when you create image of the vm will it reusable??
2 : when you create image of the vm will it be having same disk??
3 : snapshot of the disk 
4 : when you generalize the vm ?wil it be reusable?
5 : If you create image of the vm witout generalizing will it get started after creating custom image?
5 : What is RBAC and policy 
6 : How to connect individual vms when we created scaleset??is it should be connected loadbalancer
7 : Need to understand scaleset and loadbalancer to connect through it
